<h1>The Absolute Vanilla Guide to Webaudio Csound</h1> 

<p>
This repository holds a step-by-step guide to using Webaudio Csound (aka Csound
WASM) from an absolute vanilla perspective. This means that we are
going to try to demonstrate its use with a minimum of requirements and
dependencies. This guide should be useful if you are
</p>

<ul>
<li> already used to Csound, but with little JS or web app development
  experience. </li>
<li> someone with little knowledge of Csound or JS, but is keen to
  know what's all about. </li>
<li>  an experienced Csounder who wants to find more ways to deploy
  your music. </li>
<li>  has some experience with certain web environments like p5.js and
  wants to add audio to your practice. </li>
</ul>

<p>
These tutorials are not designed for
</p>

<ul>
<li> learning Csound. </li>
<li> finding out about the sound processing capabilities of Csound. </li>
<li> learning JS and modern Web app development practices. </li>
<li> a web app developer wanting to use Csound as a package in your
toolkit </li>
</ul>

<p>
For the first of the above, look at the resources listed at <a href="https://csound.com/get-started.html">learning Csound</a> and follow the links. Also look for
courses and videos on the system that may be available (online or otherwise).
To find out about the processing capabilities, also look at <a
href="https://csound.com">csound.com</a>, <a
href="https://cabbageaudio.com/">Cabbage</a>,
and the work at places like <a
href="https://puremagnetik.com/">Puremagnetik</a> where you can see
Csound used for various digital audio applications.
Finally, if you are a web developer or want to become one, using Csound WASM as part of your ecosystem,
it is probably best if you follow Steven and Hlodver's <a
href="http://kunstmusik.github.io/icsc2022-csound-web">tutorials</a>.
</p>

<p>
The tutorials here are organised in the various sub-directories, each with a README explaining what you will see in the code (which is also fully annotated). The repository has everything you need to run the examples locally, and if you want to deploy the pages to your own site, it is just a matter of copying the sources (html, js, csd, etc) as required. The Csound WASM code is given in the js directory of
these sources. You can also fork this whole repository to start your
own Csound WASM projects.

</p>

<h2>
Requirements
</h2>

<p>
There are no external dependencies or requirements, but you will need
</p>

<ol>
<li> An up-to-date modern browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc). </li>  
<li> A command-line interpreter (e.g. a terminal, or command.com on
Windows) to 
run a local web server, git, etc.  </li>
<li> A text editor to write html/JS. </li>
</ol>

<p>
Pages containing Csound WASM code need to be served via http (the file
protocol is not enough). You will need to run a local http server, for
this you can use Python3, through the command
</p>

<code>
python3 -m http.server
</code>

<p>
The root of the web server is located in the working directory from
where you run this command. The examples in this repository expect
this to be run from the top-level directory.
There are other alternatives to this: you can run the node.js `http-server`, if you have it installed.
</p>

<p>
In any case, the URL you will need to give your browser is
`localhost:port` where `port`
is set by the server as it starts up. If you were able to display this
page after starting the http server, then you are on the right track
</p>

<h2>
Tutorials
</h1>

<p>
The following are the links to the web pages containing the tutorials
in this guide. New tutorials will appear here as they are developed:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <a href="./1.Ping"> Ping<a>: import Csound WASM, start an
  engine, compile code and play a sound in response to a user
  action. </li>
<li> <a href="./2.Penta"> Penta<a>: set up a HTML button keyboard to
  control Csound events. </li>    
</ol>
